# Undervolting
 
Intel removed undervolting possibility due to Plundervolt vulnerability.
This has been implemented in BIOS Version [2.14.2](bios2142).
If you want to undervolt, stickt with Version [2.13.0](bios213).

Here is a list of fixes, that you will miss out when using 2.13.0 instead of [2.21.0](bios2210).
